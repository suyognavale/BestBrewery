# PublicAPI-
An easy demonstration/project of using a public API.

Here I have used a free and open-source brewery data
https://www.openbrewerydb.org/

The project's front-end is written using HTML, CSS, and JS 
Back-end uses NodeJS and ExpressJS for the server.

Run "npm install" command before running the project to install all the node modules.
